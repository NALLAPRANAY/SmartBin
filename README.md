# SmartBin
**With the rapid increase in urbanization 
the production of waste is increasing rapidly, 
Therefore, there is a need to improve waste 
management techniques. As the world is stepping 
towards automated and smart management 
techniques, there is a need to shift from traditional 
methods to smart waste management. This paper
discusses the ideology of automating the bin for 
opening and closing the lid and contributing to 
smart waste management techniques by 
introducing IoT-based control and monitoring of 
the dustbin**
